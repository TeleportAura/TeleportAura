I'm not particularly active on GitHub anymore due to GitHub's blatant disregard of software licenses and most of my public projects are on Codeberg nowadays  

I'm just a random skid on the Internet trying to find a purpose in life, idk  
I mostly do stuff related to Minecraft and exploiting things, feel free to check out the things I work on
